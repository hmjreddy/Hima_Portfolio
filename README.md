### Project : Cyclistic bike-share analysis - Google Data Analytics Capstone


**Business Task**

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?


- Where is your data located? 
   - 	https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
   (I have used 2021 year data from divvy-tripdata for the analysis.)
 
 (Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).) 

- **Tools used:**
    -  [R](https://github.com/hmjreddy/Hima_Portfolio/blob/58decdfb5a5073a1f7712ef0a8890dda3fa2100a/Cyclist_Capstone.Rmd)     (for merging the files and data cleaning)
    - [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/Cyclisticbike-shareanalysis-GoogleDataAnalyticsCapstone/Cyclisticbike-shareanalysis?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)    (creating Calculated fields and Visualizations)
